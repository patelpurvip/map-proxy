# Map-proxy

This repository was created to publish a [map](https://patelpurvip.github.io/map-proxy/) showing Cook County circuit court districts in Cook County (IL), populated with dummy data.  District boundaries were created using a geojason obtained from the [Cook County Central Open Data](https://hub-cookcountyil.opendata.arcgis.com/pages/boundary-open-data) page for [Judicial Districts](https://hub-cookcountyil.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/bbd5a8e81ea64fafb496b106c5723ceb_5), available in both downloadable JSON and [API](https://gis12.cookcountyil.gov/arcgis/rest/services/politicalBoundary/MapServer/5/query?where=1%3D1&outFields=*&outSR=4326&f=json) formats.  The map was published on Github pages, and then fed into the final webpage for a larger data analysis project using source data from the Cook County State's Attorney's Office (CSSAO).
